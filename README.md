# Sorting Visualizer

Visualizing sorting algorithms is like witnessing a dance of data, each step designed to organize chaos into order. Bubble sort's repetitive sways bring smaller elements to the forefront, while merge sort elegantly orchestrates a synchronized ballet of partitioning and merging. Quick sort dazzles with its swift pivots, like a nimble performer changing directions with finesse. Selection sort's methodical movements resemble a diligent sorter carefully selecting the next best candidate. As the algorithms pirouette through arrays, their distinct personalities emerge, turning a mundane task into a captivating spectacle of efficiency and elegance. ðŸ’ƒâœ¨ðŸ•º
